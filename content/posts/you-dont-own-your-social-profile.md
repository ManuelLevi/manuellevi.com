Social profiles don't belong to their creators, but to the platforms they're in.

When you post something on LinkedIn, Medium, or even Twitter, you think it's your post, your content. Well, it's not.At any point, any of these platforms might decide your content is not longer interesting, or even worse, acceptable.These platforms can remove your content at any time, or even restrict your access to it.

This just happened to Jordan Peterson

When you have a profile on social media or a blogging platform, the truth is you don't own it. They do. They are allowing you to post on their platform and in return they are getting free content and selling your data and advertising space, making money of you, while controlling what you can or cannot post.

## (In)visible Censorship

We all know what censorship is, but not many people know what a shadow ban is.

This is how wikipedia defines it: "Shadow banning, also called stealth banning, hellbanning, ghost banning or comment ghosting, is the practice of blocking or partially blocking a user or their content from some areas of an online community in such a way that it will not be readily apparent to the user that they have been banned. For instance, shadow banned comments posted to a blog or media website will not be visible to other users accessing the site.".

While the content still lives on the website, it will either not be recommended, or not be shown at all. The author things they are posting something and that that something will be read by their audience, however, the people who control the platforms can very easily control which articles to show and which ones not to show.

I believe this is worse than traditional censorship. With traditional censorship, people know they are being censored, it's honest, it's straight, and people can act on it. With this kind of subtle action, shadow banning, people don't know they are being silenced, it also doesn't raise many political questions, and many times it's very hard to prove.

So when we read that Russia is censoring the media we obviously criticize, however when this censorship is invisible, it becomes very hard to prove and concretise.

## Platforms die

Friendster, Fotolog, Hi5, Orkut, Google+. If you know anything about the history of the internet, you know at least a couple of these. You also know these are defunct or obsolete by comparison to what they once were.Millions of people have used these platforms, either with their own content with photos and articles, or interacting with other users' content through likes and comments. All that time and effort is now reduced to memories or an archive that these people no longer have access to.Don't let your content die with the platforms it lives in.
