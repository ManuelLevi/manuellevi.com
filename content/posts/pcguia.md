 [EAl](https://eai.company) worked with [Kheiron Medical Technologies](https://www.kheironmed.com/) in developing a project for the detection of breast cancer. With further developments in this project, the company was the first in England to obtain the 'CE Marking' for the application of deep learning technology in radiology.[Enlightenment.AI](https://eai.company) (EAI) is a startup that makes projects in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to help companies "capitalize their data in the most effective way possible" and make "significant, lasting and sustainable improvements in their performance," explains Manuel Levi, founder, and CEO of the technology.

After having been abroad, he reveals that, when he returned, he felt that the area of data science was still "very underdeveloped"; therefore, Manuel Levi brought together a group of data scientists and aspiring data scientists, in which one stood out: Miguel Cabrita, the other founder of EAl.

The creation of the startup began when they both realized one reality:

> Organizations don't really know what data science is, how and where to apply it.

And so, AI developed the FORCE methodology, a "set of well-defined steps that any company can follow and adapt to its needs" to develop a data strategy. The name comes from the "five pillars that defines it - Foundation, Observation, Resilience, Competence and Expansion", explains Manuel Levi. The founder also reminds that this tool was created because companies "try to apply super advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, before they even have their data organized or an infrastructure that supports these analyses".

## A PLATFORM WITH "FORCE"



[Enlightenment.AI](https://enlightenment.ai) works with clients to "really understand what factors are limiting growth" and focuses "all its efforts" here.

These are from various sectors, national and international, including "banking, investment funds, retail, transport, tourism and health" (Carlsberg, EDP, and BPI, for example), where, generally, the focus is "to make more money or reduce costs".

Currently, the startup is creating a platform called [DataStrategy.AI](https://datastrategy.ai), which "digitizes FORCE and serves as a guide for companies in their construction and execution of their data strategy," says the CEO.

Furthermore, this solution has another advantage: "The integration of data ingestion and building generic artificial intelligence models with little complexity but allowing users to see some return at a lower cost, when compared to developing these models with an internal or external team".

Concerning the future, Manuel Levi has no doubts about success, despite the "moment of instability", which translates into "retraction in investment in innovation", especially after the startup was considered by the Agência Nacional de Inovação (ANI) (National Innovation Agency) as "suitable to practice R&D" in the areas of data science, IoT and artificial intelligence. The responsible says it was "one of the best recognitions received" and a confirmation that the company is in the "right direction", which "is very rewarding".

The entrepreneur believes in the added value of this support from ANI: "It will allow us to have access to more opportunities, not only because of the trust placed in the company by this authority, but also because of the tax advantages that Portuguese clients will now have access to".
