* June, 18
  * I ask a company for my personal data through support, who closed my conversation and directs me to an e-mail.
  * That same day I exchange conversations through e-mail with Glovo. Requiring them to send me all the personal data they keep about me, as well as the reasons why they keep this data.
  * They close this ticket, ignoring my request.
* June, 22
  * I send a new e-mail, remembering them to send me all the personal information they have about me, including all conversations with their support, and other information. I quote their own privacy policy, as well as the Portuguese constitutional law and some of the GDPR rules. I have the right to all of the personal information they keep about me. I also warn them that they are going against the law and that this will be communicated with the authorities if they don't abide by it.
  * As a reply, they tell me I can **open the app and take screenshots** of the application to get access to the information, and I get a notification stating the conversation was over. I open the app, only to confirm that it's not possible to get access to the information requested. In fact the information provided is only the most basic and related with payments and addresses.
  * I reply back to Glovo, again requesting the information.
