This is not a regular checklist, it's more like a table of settings that will increase the probability of a successful print.

It is not focused on quality, speed, or weight.

It's focused on getting a **successful print, consistently**.

## Materials

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
| ---- | ---- |
| PLA | ABS - Not worth it! |
| PETG | |

## Bed adhesion

| Prototype | Small parts | Large parts | Tall parts |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Small brim | Small brim | Large brim | Large brim |

Yes, it's worth it. Whatever you think you're wasting on the brim, you're saving on failed prints.

## Print Speed

| Prototype | Small parts | Large parts | Tall parts |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 25% faster | Default | Default | Sloooowwww.... |

It's better to waste machine time than human time and frustration dealing with failed tall prints. Be patient, and take it slow. If the print is good, you'll use it for a while, so what if it takes an extra hour or two? You'll probably lose it if you don't print it slowly anyway...
