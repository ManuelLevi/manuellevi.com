In the book "Trust me, I'm lying", Ryan Holiday describes how he manipulated the media to promote his clients' ideas and brands. Ryan used a collection of fake posts, fake accounts to create controversial posts that would then be published and promoted within the groups where they would be most inflammatory. Ryan said he tried multiple emotions and sentiments to spread his posts but nothing worked as well as anger.

Ryan is not the first person do use emotions and fake support to manipulate the media. Governments, large corporations, lobbies and other institutions have a very strong motivation to change how the majority of people thinks about something.

Associated with this concept is the idea of **false consensus effect**, or **consensus bias**. This cognitive bias causes people to believe their own choices and judgments are common and shared with the majority of the population. This means it's not very difficult to stimulate someone to think their ideas are right, and supported by most people, even if they're not.

Now, if you get media manipulation together with the false consensus effect you might reach a situation where the ideas that are best promoted can very easily be assumed to be shared by the majority of the people, while other ideas, carrying the same support, or even more, might seem as very unpopular.

This is, I believe, especially true with politics.

## Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro, and Duterte

I remember what the media was saying about Brexit, Trump, Bolsonaro and Duterte.

Some people criticized, others mocked. Everyone was very vocal and even proud about **not supporting** them. They were not supposed to be popular. They were not supposed to be supported by the majority of people. Not even close.

I believe this was caused by an organized mass shaming effect. People were afraid to share their honest opinion, fearing of being judged negatively and many would lie. This effect is called **preference falsification,** and its believed  to be caused by people opting to state a preference to a researcher or a pollster that is more acceptable socially, than their true honest opinion.

It's natural. People want to "fit in" with what is the perceived consensus of the group.

The problem is that these oppressed people will express themselves once they have the safety of anonymity.

I'm not defending Trump, Brexit or any other idea. I'm instead giving examples of people and ideas who some said "would never be supported" and even called "a joke", but that actually won.

At the same time, we also know today that some of these ideas were promoted through media manipulation using many different channels, **including social media.**

**Something worth noting**: these ideas were selected through some kind of democratic process. If you believe they should be removed from action/government without due process, then you don't believe in democracy.

## Cancel Culture

With today's cancel culture, this is even worse. Some very vocal people get together to mass shame ideas, and many times, even a specific person. The idea with these organized efforts is that others start believing this is the majority's opinion, however this is only how the ideas are perceived.

When people are afraid to share their honest opinion, they stop doing it. They don't stop having it, they just stop communicating it. Instead of engaging in healthy dialog and even conflict, these people just stand in silence, even if they represent a silent majority.

If someone doesn't like the popular idea, they might vote for the unpopular idea, just to be heard. Just to tell the world, anonymously what they truly believe. And then...accidents happen. The wrong person gets elected. The wrong law passes.

This is dangerous, for everyone.

## Solution

This was supposed to be a short article about why it's important to democratize and distribute content creation and distribution.

Today's distribution platforms are either:

* Government controlled;
* Tech-company controlled;
* large-media group controlled;
* or a combination of these.

These people control what is true and what is not. What is relevant and what is irrelevant.

The alternative is to distribute this power through multiple and independent websites, and find ways to aggregate this information using existing technologies like RSS.
