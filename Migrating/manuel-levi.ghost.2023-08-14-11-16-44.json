Hopefully, I'll be able to identify some problems and propose\nsolutions to those same problems.\n\nWhile I review these smart contracts, I'll also create a short checklist for my\nsmart-contract development. Learn from others' mistakes and prevent your own.\n\nWhat is a presale smart contract?\nThe concept is simple.\n\nSome crypto projects offer their tokens for sale while the project is still\nunder development and sometimes even before development starts. It's called a\npresale because they typically happen before the main token distribution.\n\nSometimes access to a presale is restricted, other times it's not.

There are no reasons to keep them in the code\nthough.\n\nWhich takes us to a few lines bellow:\n\n...\n    // best guess ETH price\n    uint public constant dollarsPerETH = 1552;\n    uint public constant tokensPerDollar = 4;\n    uint public constant tokensPerETH = dollarsPerETH * tokensPerDollar;\n...\n\nAs we can see, instead of fixing the price at USD, the project team fixed the\nprice to ETH.\n\nThis presale contract was published at Feb-03-2021 (18:06:34 UTC). \n\nAt that time ETH was not costing 1552 USD, but 1630 USD (5% more). During the\npresale time, the price never came down to 1552, however, it reached 1695\nUSD(Binance) at one point.\n\nThat means that the contract was selling MFI for more than 0.27 cents, 2 cents,\nor 8% over the defined listing price.\n\n\nSince a presale has the objective of being cheaper than the listing price and\nknowing all these transactions have associated Ethereum fees, I wouldn't be too\nhappy as an early investor.\n\nAdding to our checklist:\n\n * Checklist * Make sure our interfaces only define the necessary functions;\n   \n   \n * If you're going to keep \"total\" variables, make sure you update them.\n * Define all variables that will not be changed as constant or immutable. \n   constant for variables defined at compile-time and immutable for variables\n   whose value is defined at construction time.\n * (NEW) Deadcode: * Remove any unused variables.\n    * Remove any unused functions.\n    * Remove any unused interfaces and interfaces' functions.\n   \n   \n * (NEW) If you're going to define prices: * Use price oracles to get a current\n      price or define it in ETH.\n   \n   \n\nEDIT: turns out Etherscan thinks the price for ETH went as high as 1721 USD,\nconsiderably increasing the price error for this presale.\n\nVesting\nThe next part of the contract relates to vesting. \n\nVesting is a mechanism used in crypto and presales, mainly to give some security\nto the investors that the people raising the money will not simply sell their\ntokens and run away from the project, in what is called a rug-pull.\n\n\n\n    uint public startDate;\n    uint public lastVestedQuarter;\n    // 1_500_000 / 8\n    uint public constant vestingQuarterly = 187_500 ether;\n\n\nIn their token distribution article, they have planned an initial distribution\nof 4'000'000 tokens, with 1'500'000 of these (15%) allocated directly to the\nteam. We can see the first value assigned to the variable presaleSupply and the\nsecond one being written here as 1_500_000 for the comment justifying how many\nMFI can be withdrawn each quarter. According to their medium article, the\nvesting should\nlast 2 years, or 8 quarters.\n\nThe function below allows withdrawing the vested tokens:\n\n...\n    // send vested tokens back to treasury\n    function withdrawVested() external {\n        uint timeDiff = block.timestamp - startDate;\n        uint quarter = timeDiff / (90 days);\n        if (quarter > lastVestedQuarter) {\n            MFI.transfer(treasury, vestingQuarterly);\n            lastVestedQuarter = quarter;\n        }\n    }\n...\n\nThere's a problem with this function. Can you see it? No?\n\nWell, there's a big one.\n\nIf don't see it, don't worry. I plan to explain it in part 2 of this article if\nthere's enough interest.\n\nPart 2?\nI hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\nThere are still a few things a would like to explore:\n\n * The problem with the vesting function;\n * The importance of get and set functions (thanks João Andrade\n   [https://twitter.com/jpm_andrade95]!);\n * How to get more tokens in the same wallet than you should be allowed to\n   (exploitable nature of contracts like this);\n * Some blockchain analysis on the contract:\n * How many tokens were sold?\n * Did everyone get their tokens?\n * Did anyone get more tokens in their wallet than they should?",

Verify that you're able to take a screenshot\\n\\nTo do this, run the code\\n\\n`pyautogui.screenshot('screenshot.png')`\\n\\nCheck the screenshot. Can you see all your windows, or just the background?\\n\\nIf all you can see is the background, then you need to update the \\\"Security & Privacy\\\" settings for the application that is running your code. This can be `Terminal`, or `Visual Studio Code`, or `PyCharm`.\\n\\nIf you have already done this, close the application and reopen it. I had to completely logout, since my application was running as a deamon, that was the best way to make sure it was restarted.\\n\\nAfter you've done this, test it again. It should work.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Step 2. Verify the images \\n\\nThis function needs the images to match perfectly, so make sure you have good screenshot of the images. Consider saving them in PNG format because of the way it compresses images without losing much information.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Step 3. Reduce the matching confidence\\n\\n\\nYou can install `opencv` to get access to the additional `confidence` argument.\\n\\n\\nIf you haven't installed `opencv` yet, you can do it by running `pip install opencv-python`. \\n\\n\\nAfter that you can start using the confidence argument like so:\\n`pos = pyautogui.locateOnScreen('btn.png',grayscale=True, confidence=0.9)`\\n\\n\\n\\n## `typewrite` doesn't work for symbols or inputs wrong characters\\n\\n\\n\\n`PyAutoGUI` describes itself as a \\\"cross-platform GUI automation Python module for human beings.\\\", Maybe instead the description should say \\\"module for usonian human beings\\\".\\n\\nThis bug with \\\"PyAutoGui\\\" is due to the fact that it does not know about keyboard maps, except the USA one.\\n\\nThe solution is simple, using the `keyboard` library and the `keyboard.write` function, instead of the `pyautogui.typewrite` function.\\n\\nThere are other workarounds like:\\n* changing the keyboard layout just for your automation (yuck 🤮);\\n* storing the string in the clipboard and copy-pasting (yuck 🤮);\\n* storing a character map and replacing the characters on each string you want to send (yuck 🤮).\\n\\n`pyautogui` supports thirdparty libraries like `opencv` for image matching, so it could do the same for keyboard input. Hopefuly this will happen soon.\\n\\n## `typewrite` doesn't work with unicode strings\\n\\n\\nThis is a very similar problem as the one above with probably the same root cause. Simply use one of the workarounds described above, or just replace the `pyautogui.typewrite` function with the `keyboard.write` function, and that's it! Everything should work nicely.\\n\\n## ImportError: No module named pyautogui\\n\\nManaging python environments can be a pain in the ass. Yes, you can use virtual environments and install all the libraries necessary every-single-damn-time, but that's boring AF and feels like too much when you just want to test something fast.\\n\\nTypically, you would install `pyautogui` with a simple `pip3 install pyautogui`, however this doesn't always work when outside a virtual environment (looking at you, Anaconda.).\\n\\nInstead, try the command `python3 -m pip install pyautogui`, this gives you much better chances that the library is going to be installed in the same place that your `python3` alias is looking at.\\n\\n## Can't hold key down for X seconds\\n\\nIf you're automating something that requires you to hold a key down for sometime, like the movement of a game character, you'll realize that `pyautogui.keyDown` doesn't cause key repeats. \\n\\nThe best way to do this would be by using the `hold() context manager`, like so:\\n\\n```\\nwith pyautogui.hold(key):\\n    pyautogui.sleep(hold)\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Mouse movements don't count as activity\\n\\nSometimes, you want to move the mouse using `pyautogui` to simulate activity (preventing screenlocks, showing as active on a messenger, \\n\\nMouse movements aren't always counter for activity. Instead, consider using the keyboard events. Something like pressing the volume up and volume down keys can work wonders:\\n```\\nimport pyautogui\\nimport time\\n\\nwhile True:\\n    pyautogui.press('volumedown')\\n    time.sleep(0.5)\\n    pyautogui.press('volumeup')\\n    time.sleep(60)\\n```\\n\\n## Pyautogui is not working in a particular application\\n\\n`Pyautogui` can easily be identified by specific software, like games and anti-cheating software. \\n\\nA lot of times, pyautogui isn't trying to hide. For example, the library uses Window's API and adds the `LLMHF_INJECTED` flag to its events.\\n\\nThere are at least ways around this:\\n* Write your own driver (yuck 🤮);\\n* Use a library that simulates direct input (like PyDirectInput - for windows only)\\n* Run it in a VMWare machine;\\n\\nI don't like any of these to be honest. It would be better if pyautogui had a flag that would allow you to either flag your input or not.\\n\\n**Note:** If you need something really untraceable, you can always use an Arduino to simulate key strokes as an actualy keyboard and mouse.\\n\\n## The Pillow package is required to use this function.\\n\\nThe solution is simple, you install the `Pillow` package. \\n\\nHowever, it should have been installed automatically, when you installed `pyautogui` as it is a dependency of a dependency ;)\\n\\nSo I would recommend simply installing everything again with\\n`pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pyautogui`\\n\\n## Work with me\\n\\nConnect with me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuellevi/), or through my company [Enlightenment.ai](https://Enlightenment.ai).\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}",
